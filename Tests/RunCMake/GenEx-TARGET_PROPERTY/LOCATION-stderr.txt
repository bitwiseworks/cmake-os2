CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists\.txt:
  Policy CMP0026 is not set: Disallow use of the LOCATION target property.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0026" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The LOCATION property should not be read from target "foo".  Use the target
  name directly with add_custom_command, or use the generator expression
  \$<TARGET_FILE>, as appropriate.
