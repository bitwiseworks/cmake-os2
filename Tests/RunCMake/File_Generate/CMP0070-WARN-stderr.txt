(CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0070 is not set: Define file\(GENERATE\) behavior for relative
  paths.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0070" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  file\(GENERATE\) given relative OUTPUT path:

  This is not defined behavior unless CMP0070 is set to NEW.  For
  compatibility with older versions of CMake, the previous undefined behavior
  will be used.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
